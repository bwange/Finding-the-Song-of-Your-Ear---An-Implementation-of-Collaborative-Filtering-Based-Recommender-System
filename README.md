# Finding-the-Song-of-Your-Ear---An-Implementation-of-Collaborative-Filtering-Based-Recommender-System

In this project, we are interested in utilizing collaborative filtering -based recommender system to provide recommendations to streaming-music service users when they are creating playlists. We believe the idea will add value to the streaming music business because, according to Music Business Association's publication in 2017, in the United States, over 30% of the music listening time comes from playlists, and thus a better automatic playlist continuation feature will help the industry attract and keep its users.
In our experiment, the matrix factorization based collaborative filtering algorithm yields a score of 7.527% for Precision at 10, and a score of 8.397% for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) at 10. The performances are significantly higher than the Baseline's 0.941% and 0.995% respectively. (The Baseline recommends the top 10 popular songs to the user.)
